## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This is my first project with JavaScript and I'm quite happy with how that part turned out. I've been doing some JS exercises for a while, and I was doubting myself and my abilities but I think I did a nice job. 

### Continued development

I'm pretty sure my script can be shortened by like 20 lines, and I hope to come back to this project in the future and improve the code. 

I'm aware that the hero image only occupies the full height of the body, but I wasn't able to make it fit the full height of the browser. I don't know if it's because the image's height is only 800px, or maybe I just need to refresh my knowledge of positioning :). 

### Useful resources

- [Form validation using javascript](https://dev.to/javascriptacademy/form-validation-using-javascript-34je) - I wouldn't have been able to do the JS for this challenge without this article.
- [Curso de Manipulaci√≥n del DOM](https://platzi.com/clases/dom/) - This course helped me understand how DOM manipulation works.
