## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This is my first project with JavaScript and I'm quite happy with how it turned out. I've been doing some JS exercises for a while, and I was doubting myself and my abilities but I'm really happy right now. 

### Continued development

I'm pretty sure my script can be shortened by like 20 lines, and I hope to come back to this project in the future and improve the code. 

Also I know the mobile-media-queries file is extremely long considering it's a simple project, but past me decided it was a good idea to use position absolute. Present me disagrees completely with her.

### Useful resources

- [Form validation using javascript](https://dev.to/javascriptacademy/form-validation-using-javascript-34je) - I wouldn't have been able to do the JS for this challenge without this article.
- [Curso de Manipulaci√≥n del DOM](https://platzi.com/clases/dom/) - This course helped me understand how DOM manipulation works.
